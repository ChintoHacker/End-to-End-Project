# End-to-End Placement Prediction Project

End-to-End Placement Prediction Project
This project aims to predict student placements based on experience and other relevant factors using machine learning. It follows an end-to-end approach, covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.


**Machine Learning Algorithms:**

Overview of various algorithms that were experimented with (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.). Rationale behind the selection of the final algorithm based on the performance of the model.

**Model Training and Testing:**

Procedure for splitting the data into training and testing sets. Training of the machine learning model and tuning for best performance.

**Performance Evaluation:**

Description of the evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.). Discussion of the outcome from the validation process.

**User Interface Development:**

Features and design of the user interface. Communication between the user and the model for real-time prediction of placements.

**Conclusion and Future Work**

Summary of the findings of the project. Room for improvements and further work, i.e., the inclusion of additional features such as skills or internships.

**Project Features:**

**Dataset:** Uses placement_with_experience.csv, which contains student placement data.

**Data Processing:** Cleans and preprocesses the dataset for analysis.

**Model Development:** Implements a machine learning model to predict placements.

**Model Deployment:** Saves the trained model as model.pkl for future use.

**Jupyter Notebook:** Provides step-by-step implementation in Project.ipynb.

**Usage:**
Clone the repository
Install dependencies
Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore and train the model
Use model.pkl for predictions

This project is useful for students, career advisors, and institutions aiming to analyze and predict placements efficiently.
