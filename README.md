# End-to-End Placement Prediction Project

End-to-End Placement Prediction Project
This project aims to predict student placements based on experience and other relevant factors using machine learning. It follows an end-to-end approach, covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

**Project Features:**

**Dataset:** Uses placement_with_experience.csv, which contains student placement data.
**Data Processing:** Cleans and preprocesses the dataset for analysis.
**Model Development:** Implements a machine learning model to predict placements.
**Model Deployment:** Saves the trained model as model.pkl for future use.
**Jupyter Notebook:** Provides step-by-step implementation in Project.ipynb.

**Usage:**
Clone the repository
Install dependencies
Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore and train the model
Use model.pkl for predictions

This project is useful for students, career advisors, and institutions aiming to analyze and predict placements efficiently.
